# 24 Hour Cal App

This is a calendar app built in React with Redux, Sagas, Material UI, Node.js, Express.js, Postgresql, and Heroku. It helps people easily create events. There is a weekly view, monthly view, create new event dialog, and a preferences page. The preferences page allows the user to develop auto-fill information when creating new events. The user can also click on the events on the weekly view or monthly view to edit or delete the event.
